                            <h4>CYBER SECURITY<em> BEST</em> PRACTICES</h4>
                            <h5 align="justify">
                                <br />
                                The basic principles that should guide those who
                                are called upon to create a computer,
                                information or industrial network, or to secure
                                a pre-existing one, are the ZERO TRUST and the
                                MICRO SEGMENTATION of the network regardless of
                                its size.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The ZERO TRUST principle applies not only to the
                                individuals in charge, at whatever level of
                                security, but also and above all in the choice
                                and use of the security equipment that will be
                                used to protect the network.<br />
                                <br />
                                Thus, one must avoid settling for a simple
                                application to be deployed in a replacement
                                server or purchased for the cause without
                                knowing all its characteristics and its
                                suitability for the needs of the application if
                                one wants to avoid the risk of perpetuating a
                                pre-existing contamination or malfunctioning of
                                the program.<br />
                                <br />
                                It is also important to avoid, as far as
                                possible, the intervention of a third party when
                                using the network's functions. I am thinking
                                here of the Cloud, whose negative points and
                                associated risks are well known, or of online
                                file-sharing systems offered by companies
                                outside the network. <br />
                                <br />
                                The principle of MICRO SEGMENTATION is intended
                                to limit the damage in the event that an
                                attacker manages to get a virus into the
                                network. By adhering to this principle when
                                designing the network security architecture, if
                                an attack is successful, it will only affect the
                                segment of the network that it has successfully
                                penetrated.<br />
                                <br />
                                This principle means that connections between
                                computers on the same network should be avoided
                                and direct, unprotected access between users and
                                servers should be avoided. <br />
                                Above all, you should not trust hyper-converged
                                systems that deliver everything in one program,
                                including your computer security. We all
                                remember the SolarWinds disaster. <br />
                                <br />
                                In industrial or information networks of large
                                entities, departments should be separated and
                                access to departmental servers should be
                                restricted to those who need them. <br />
                                <br />

                                With this in mind and applying these basic
                                principles of perfect cyber security, PT SYDECO
                                has created ARCHANGEL, an
                                <br />

                                Hackers must penetrate a system and introduce a
                                virus or worm of their choice, whether it is a
                                Trojan horse such as EMOTET which is a
                                Trojan-Dropper injector whose objective is to
                                install other malicious objects or any other
                                Ransomware, such as MAZE, SODINOKIBI, REvil,
                                CLAP, NEMTY... to name but a few, most of which
                                use the double extortion system, if they want to
                                steal data, encrypt it to obtain a ransom or
                                simply to cause harm.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                There are at least 7 ways to do this, almost all
                                of which require action on the part of the
                                victim. By far the most common method is social
                                engineering. It includes phishing (spearfishing,
                                smishing, vishing...) and the game is usually to
                                manipulate vulnerable targets into one of three
                                types of behaviour: clicking on a fraudulent
                                link, opening a malicious attachment or entering
                                data into a booby-trapped input field, such as a
                                fake login page on (what appears to be) a
                                corporate website.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Methods that involve manipulation of the victim
                                include phishing and social engineering,
                                infection via a compromised website, exploit
                                kits that provide custom malware, infected files
                                and application downloads, and email
                                applications as infection vectors.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                On the other hand, victim intervention is not
                                necessary when cybercriminals use brute force
                                such as RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) or
                                malicious advertising and browser intrusion of
                                common advertisements on websites where they can
                                insert malicious code that will download the
                                ransomware as soon as an advertisement
                                appears.<br />
                                <br />
                                In all cases, the user's e-mail is the company's
                                entry point.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The best way to protect a computer system is to
                                know the means used by attackers to achieve
                                their goals.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                This is what PT SYDECO researchers have done to
                                create the ARCHANGEL integrated protection
                                system. Of course, user education is necessary,
                                even indispensable, but since mistakes are
                                human, even the best network administrator is
                                not immune to an inadvertent mistake.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                It is also essential to block or at least reduce
                                access within a company to the sites that are
                                most used by hackers, such as Facebook,
                                WhatsApp, Amazon, Apple and Netflix, which,
                                according to Kaspersky Security Network (KSN),
                                were the subject of 4.5 million, 3.7 million,
                                3.3 million, 3.1 million and 2.7 million
                                phishing attempts respectively in the period
                                from April to September 2020.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                In these conditions, it was necessary to create
                                a system that protects a network against threats
                                (which can be a cyber attack as well as the
                                intervention of a man in the middle) coming from
                                the outside world (Internet) but also against
                                those coming from the network itself through the
                                voluntary or involuntary fault of one of its
                                users, whether they work within the company or
                                outside it.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Similarly, it has been found that protection
                                provided by a simple program that a user would
                                install in a server or PC that he/she owns or
                                acquires, offers no guarantee of security, as
                                the host device may contain a backdoor or be
                                already contaminated or affected by a rootkit.
                                This is why the ARCHANGEL integrated protection
                                system is installed in hardware created and
                                supplied by PT SYDECO.

                                It soon became clear that a simple firewall
                                could not fulfill these tasks. The ARCHANGEL
                                integrated system, which combines a new
                                generation firewall (ARCHANGEL©), a keyless
                                encryption system (SST©), a VPN server and an
                                online file sharing system (SydeCloud©) in one
                                box, meets these needs.

                                only to block traffic with regard to its
                                signature, thus preventing it from blocking
                                traffic when its signature is encrypted, thus
                                hidden, ARCHANGEL blocks the execution of all
                                programs, whether they are encrypted or not.
                                This is the reason why ARCHANGEL must be
                                installed after a proxi (intermediary between

                                - This system, created by PT SYDECO, does not
                                use any keys. It is part of the system because
                                it protects passwords. Indeed, traditional
                                cryptography is based on algorithms,
                                mathematical functions which do not resist more
                                than one second to an attack by a Quantum
                                Computer.

                                - SST is not based on a mathematical method and
                                is therefore QUANTUM SAFE.
                                <br />

                                - SST protects the network against brute force
                                attacks.
                                <br />

                                - If users download SST into their work tools,
                                their data will also be protected by SST.
