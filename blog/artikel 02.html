                                when you know what a password manager is and how
                                it works.<br />
                                <br />

                                <h4>WHAT IS A PASSWORD MANAGER ?</h4>
                                <br />
                                There are several definitions of a password
                                manager. We can talk about a computer program
                                that allows users to store, generate and manage
                                their passwords, about an encrypted digital safe
                                that store all your passwords, but the best
                                definition must be sought from the objective
                                pursued by the companies that create them and
                                promote their use.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The underlying idea is to allow a user to have
                                at any time and in any place all the passwords
                                he uses by memorizing or retaining only one, the
                                one which gives him access to all his passwords,
                                i.e. the password manager.
                                <br />

                            <h4>
                                WHERE DOES THE IDEA OF CREATING A PASSWORD
                                MANAGER COME FROM?

                                The main reason would be that users who rely on
                                memory share similar passwords across multiple
                                platforms or do not create passwords strong
                                enough to withstand a half-hour brute force
                                attack on their identity by a cybercriminal.

                                <br />
                                As a result, those who rely on their memory to
                                conduct their online activities would be twice
                                as likely to have their identity or credentials
                                attacked by cyber security threats.

                                save passwords.

                                <h4><em>HOW DOES IT WORK?</em></h4>
                                <br />
                                Some password managers generate random
                                passwords, made up of an unusual combination of
                                anything accessible on a keyboard. They then
                                assign these passwords to each of the user's
                                online platforms, so that no single key can open
                                all the locks. The safes also remember these
                                passwords, so the user does not need to write
                                them down. Just keep your phone safe and your
                                safe under a local password (1).
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Other password managers record the username and
                                password that is used when first logging in to a
                                website or service and, on subsequent logins,
                                will automatically fill in the login credentials
                                with the recorded login information.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Usually the passwords can be accessed from
                                anywhere through the manager app or its browser
                                extension (2).
                                <br />
                                <br />

                                <h4>RISKS:</h4>
                                <br />
                                The main risk is that the password manager is
                                hacked, which is not just a thought. History
                                shows that this has already happened and that
                                the credentials of users of this password
                                manager have been compromised.
                                <br />
                                This is how the hack of Passwordstate's update
                                mechanism allowed hackers to potentially steal
                                data (stored passwords, the ones for firewalls,
                                VPNs, switches, local accounts and servers) from
                                29,000 companies! (3)
                                <br />
                                Also, many LastPass users have reported that
                                their master passwords have been compromised
                                after receiving email warnings that someone
                                tried to use them to log into their accounts
                                from unknown locations. The email notifications
                                also state that the login attempts were blocked
                                because they were made from unknown locations
                                around the world (4).
                                <br />
                                A study by security.org of 1,077 people of all
                                ages, genders and sexualities found that one in
                                five people used a password manager, which
                                equates to about 45 million people in the US. Of
                                these, one in three people have had some part of
                                their identity or online credentials stolen in a
                                cyber security breach, which is very serious (5)

                                <h4>OUR ADVICE:</h4>
                                <br />
                                The best advice we can give is to assume that
                                security in general and IT security in
                                particular is priceless in the sense that it is
                                better to go to the trouble of creating and
                                managing hard to crack passwords than to resort
                                to the ease of having them generated by a third
                                party.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The golden rule of IT security is to keep
                                control of your password creation and
                                management, and not to entrust them to a
                                password management company that uses the cloud,
                                which is highly susceptible to attack.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                You can always keep your passwords on a separate
                                piece of paper or outside of any internet
                                connection. You can also use PT SYDECO's
                                SydeCloud service which is an online file
                                sharing service. Its server is hosted on your
                                premises, protected by the ARCHANGEL integrated
                                protection system. In addition, all
                                communication is protected by a VPN whose server
                                is a component of the integrated protection
                                system. No third party services are used, so any
                                risk of external interference is eliminated.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                However, you should always bear in mind that the
                                password you create should be a long string of
                                upper and lower case letters, numbers,
                                punctuation marks and non-alphanumeric
                                characters so that it is difficult for someone
                                else to guess and you do not have to change it
                                periodically.

                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Think of a sentence consisting of at least 4
                                words, each written in a different language,
                                with some characters replaced by non-alphabetic
                                ones.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                An example:
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                1st step: Create a sentence of a minimum of 4
                                words that you will easily remember: "I speak
                                four languages"
                                <br />
                                2nd step: translate 3 of these words, each in
                                another language: “Je bicara куатре ennimi” and
                                <br />
                                3rd step: change some characters BUT do not
                                allocate the same value to the same character if
                                it appears several times in the sentence.
